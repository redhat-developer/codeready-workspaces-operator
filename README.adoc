## Building CRW Operator and Metadata containers

### Operator container

* The CRW operator has most of code in the upstream link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/[che-operator] repo, including this link:https://github.com/eclipse-che/che-operator/blob/master/Dockerfile[Dockerfile].

* This code is then synced to the link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[downstream repo] via a job located here:

  - https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs)
  - https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources)
  - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)

The Jenkinsfile transforms the Che code into CRW code and commits the changed code directly to downstream so there's no need for a branch in che-operator or to have code duplicated here. 

NOTE: The job can be configured to sync from any upstream che-operator branch, eg., `SOURCE_BRANCH` = `7.26.x` or `master`.

* Once the sync is done:

** the link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator] repo is updated;

** a Brew build will be triggered via **get-sources-rhpkg-container-build** job

** and, if successful, the Brew build will be copied to Quay] as `https://quay.io/crw/crw-2-rhel8-operator`.

### Metadata container

* Metadata for the CRW operator is contained in this repo. See link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/manifests[manifests], link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/metadata[metadata] and link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/bundle[bundle] folders, and this link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/blob/master/operator-metadata.Dockerfile[operator-metadata.Dockerfile].

* The metadata is then synced to the link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[downstream repo] via a job located here:

  - https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs)
  - https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources)
  - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)

NOTE: The job can be configured to sync from any upstream che-operator branch, eg., `SOURCE_BRANCH` = `7.26.x` or `master`.

* Once the sync is done:

** the link:http://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/containers/codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata/?h=crw-2-rhel-8[codeready-workspaces-operator-metadata] repo is updated;

** a Brew build will be triggered via **get-sources-rhpkg-container-build** job

** and, if successful, the Brew build will be copied to Quay] as `https://quay.io/crw/crw-2-rhel8-operator-metadata`.

### crwctl CLI binary

* Once the operator and metadata is rebuilt, a new build of link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl[crwctl] is triggered.

* This is triggered because the CRW operator-metadata's link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-operator/tree/master/bundle[bundle folder] is used in crwctl to do deployment when there is no OLM present on the target cluster (OCP 3.11 and 4.1).

See crwctl job located here:

  - https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp4.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs)
  - https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources)
  - https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)
